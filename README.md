## Introduction

Sentiment Analysis on Movie Reviews is a project developed to analyze and classify sentiments expressed in user reviews. The machine learning model is trained on a dataset containing labeled movie reviews, and the web application allows users to input their own text for sentiment analysis.

## Features

- **User-friendly Interface:** The web application provides an intuitive interface for users to input text and receive sentiment analysis results.

- **Sentiment Classification:** The machine learning model classifies the sentiment of the input text as positive, negative, or neutral.

- **Interactive Visualization:** The application displays visualizations to help users understand the sentiment distribution in the provided text.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-sentiment-analysis.git
   ```

2. Change into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd movie-sentiment-analysis
   ```
## Usage

1. Run the Flask application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. Open your web browser and go to [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

3. Input the text you want to analyze and submit the form to receive sentiment analysis results.

## Machine Learning Model

The sentiment analysis model is built using natural language processing libraries such as [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/) or [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/). The model is trained on a dataset with labeled movie reviews.

## Web Application

The web application is developed with Python Flask, providing a user-friendly platform for users to input text and receive sentiment analysis results.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Flask
- Natural Language Processing libraries (NLTK, scikit-learn)
- HTML/CSS
